# Web3-Powered Animal Rescue System

This project aims to reduce response times in animal rescue operations by leveraging Web3 technology to create a stake and reward system. By utilizing blockchain, we ensure transparency, efficiency, and accountability in the rescue process.
For a detailed presentation of the project, please refer to [PPT of this project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gKrnNNRuXmrjAj4v2sHcIrEpkHo2-u_F/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=105630494059561252253&rtpof=true&sd=true).

## Key Features

1. **Initial Token Allocation**: Each new user is given 5 ERC20 staking tokens upon joining the platform, which they can use to participate in the animal rescue system.

2. **Issuing a Rescue Request**: Users can issue a rescue request by staking their tokens, which triggers the rescue operation and ensures the request is taken seriously.

3. **Reward for Successful Rescues**: If the animal is rescued successfully and in a timely manner, the user is rewarded with additional tokens, incentivizing the reporting of genuine emergencies.

4. **Deterrence of False Issues**: Staking tokens helps prevent false rescue requests, as users have a vested interest in only reporting genuine emergencies to avoid losing their staked tokens.

5. **Accountability Mechanism**: If the animal is not rescued in time, the staked tokens are rewarded to the user, highlighting the driverâ€™s negligence to higher authorities and ensuring accountability within the rescue operations.
